<h1>Zen Garden
    </h1>
<p>Zen Garden is so interesting because anyone can take all their ideas and put it in their own context. Users of Zen Gerden can use their creativity to the maximum and make a webpage that makes people want to look at it. It is also interesting because every single webpage is different which shows the creativity of all the users.

<p> My favorite design is The Final Ending by Ray Henry. While it is a little creepy I can get over that to see the amazing things he did in his website. Anything from the blood splatters all across the background of the webpage and the font to the pop up at the bottom of the screen of a grave that says Happy Halloween is very impressive. The border style he uses is very unique. It goes along with the blood splatters across the webpage as he made the borders look like blood as well.
